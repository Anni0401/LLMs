What do you guys think?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with teammember_RED_2 and teammember_RED_3, IRON is a strong candidate. For the second word, I think COMPOUND itself is unlikely since it is not a type of metal, but OIL is a good guess. Another option could be a word that is made of metal, such as a part of a building or structure. What about SKYSCRAPER or BLOCK, could they be related to metal?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think SKYSCRAPER and BLOCK are good guesses, but I am not sure if they are directly related to metal. What about IRON and OIL, do you guys think they are strong candidates? Should we guess one of them first?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_3 - Guess:</strong><p>IRON</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_3 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think we should guess IRON first, since it is a direct match for the hint. If it is correct, we can then discuss our next guess. What do you guys think?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_1 - Guess:</strong><p>IRON</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> incorrect - invalid guess</p></div><div class="spymaster-blue"><strong>Spymaster - Clue:</strong> BUILDING, 3</div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>What are your thoughts on the hint BUILDING? I think we should start with the obvious ones like SKYSCRAPER and STADIUM.</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with you on SKYSCRAPER and STADIUM. I also think we should consider BLOCK as it could be related to building blocks.</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Guess:</strong><p>SKYSCRAPER</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Guess:</strong><p>STADIUM</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Guess:</strong><p>BLOCK</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="spymaster-red"><strong>Spymaster - Clue:</strong> WHITE, 2</div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>What are your thoughts on the hint WHITE 2? I think it could relate to IVORY and possibly something else.</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_3 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with IVORY, and I also think it could relate to ICE CREAM. What do you think, teammember_RED_1?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with IVORY and ICE CREAM. I also think it could relate to SHARK, as in a great white shark. What do you think?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with IVORY and ICE CREAM, but I am not sure about SHARK. I think we should guess IVORY first and then discuss the next possible word.</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_3 - Guess:</strong><p>IVORY</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_3 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with guessing IVORY first.

Should we focus on words related to flying or air travel?</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think we should focus on words related to flying or air travel. I also think we should consider words that are related to people or things that fly.</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_1 - Guess:</strong><p>PILOT</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think PILOT is a strong candidate. What do you think about the word FLY?</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Guess:</strong><p>FLY</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> incorrect - opponent</p></div><div class="spymaster-red"><strong>Spymaster - Clue:</strong> INTELLIGENCE, 2</div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think the hint INTELLIGENCE could relate to words that describe smart or intelligent things. What are your thoughts?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_3 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree, INTELLIGENCE could relate to smart or intelligent things. I think GENIUS is a strong candidate, as it directly relates to high intelligence.</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with both of you, INTELLIGENCE does relate to smart or intelligent things. GENIUS is a strong candidate, but we should also consider other options like LAWYER, as they are often perceived as intelligent professionals.</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_1 - Guess:</strong><p>GENIUS</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with both of you, and I think we should also consider other options like RULER, as they are often perceived as intelligent leaders.</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_3 - Guess:</strong><p>LAWYER</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="spymaster-blue"><strong>Spymaster - Clue:</strong> COVER, 3</div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>What are your thoughts on the hint COVER? I think it could relate to CLOAK, GROUND, or COMPOUND.</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with CLOAK, but I also think it could relate to KETCHUP as in covering food, and maybe even CAR as in car cover. What do you think?</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I see what you mean about KETCHUP and CAR, but I think CLOAK is the strongest connection. What about COMPOUND, do you think it could be related to COVER?</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think COMPOUND could be related to COVER in the sense of a covered area, but I still think CLOAK is the strongest connection. What do you think about guessing CLOAK first?</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_1 - Guess:</strong><p>CLOAK</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Guess:</strong><p>CLOAK</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> incorrect - invalid guess</p></div><div class="spymaster-red"><strong>Spymaster - Clue:</strong> SLIPPERY, 2</div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think SLIPPERY could relate to something that is smooth or hard to hold onto. What are your thoughts?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree, SLIPPERY could relate to something smooth or hard to hold onto. I think OIL could be a good fit, as it is a smooth substance. What do you guys think about OIL?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_3 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with you guys, SLIPPERY could relate to something smooth or hard to hold onto. I also think OIL could be a good fit, but we should also consider other options like KETCHUP, as it is also a smooth substance. What do you guys think about KETCHUP?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_1 - Guess:</strong><p>OIL</p><p><strong>Outcome:</strong> correct</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I agree with you guys, OIL seems like a good fit. I also think KETCHUP could be a good fit, but I want to discuss other options as well. What do you guys think about WORM, could it be related to SLIPPERY?</p></div><div class="guesser-red"><strong>guesser_RED_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think WORM could be a good fit, as it is a smooth and slippery creature. I also think we should consider other options like SHARK, as it is a fish that is known to be slippery.

I also think we should look for another food item that could be related to SAUCE. What do you think about other options?</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think we should look for a food item that is often served with a sauce. What do you think about CAR, could it be related to a car sauce or a type of car that is named after a sauce?</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think CAR is unlikely to be related to a sauce, but I do think there could be another food item on the board that is related to SAUCE. What do you think about COMPOUND, could it be related to a type of sauce or a compound ingredient in a sauce?</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_2 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think COMPOUND is unlikely to be related to a sauce, but I do think there could be another food item on the board that is related to SAUCE. What do you think about BOOM, could it be related to a type of sauce or a boom in flavor?</p></div><div class="guesser-blue"><strong>guesser_BLUE_1 - Discuss:</strong><p>I think BOOM is unlikely to be related to a sauce, but I do think there could be another food item on the board that is related to SAUCE.
