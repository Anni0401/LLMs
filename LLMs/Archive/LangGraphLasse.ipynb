'DEGREE': 0% - No apparent connection to 'POST'.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed that 'POST' is already in the grid and has a high probability score. Since the clue is for 2 words, I will look for another word that might be related to 'POST'. \\n\\nOne possible connection is 'MAIL' or 'LETTER', but none of these words are in the grid. However, I can think of a word that might be related to 'POST' in a different sense - 'POST' as in a position or a job. In this case, 'POST' could be related to 'OFFICE' or 'WORK', but again, none of these words are in the grid.\\n\\nAnother possible connection is 'POST' as in a physical post or a pole. In this case, 'POST' could be related to 'BRIDGE' or 'SATELLITE' (as in a satellite post or a satellite dish on a pole), but these connections are quite weak.\\n\\nHowever, I noticed that 'POST' could be related to 'SCREEN' in the sense that a screen can be posted or displayed. This connection is not very strong, but it's possible.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, my top guesses are:\\n\\n1. 'POST' (100%): Direct match to the clue.\\n2. 'SCREEN' (20%): Possible connection to 'POST' in the sense that a screen can be posted or displayed.\\n\\nPlease note that these probability scores are subjective and based on my analysis of the words in the grid.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 656, 'prompt_tokens': 526, 'total_tokens': 1182, 'completion_time': 2.624, 'prompt_time': 0.107476249, 'queue_time': 0.00374529400000001, 'total_time': 2.731476249}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-70b-versatile', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_b3ae7e594e', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-34e04930-d849-479e-9fab-fd36a52e4f7e-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 526, 'output_tokens': 656, 'total_tokens': 1182}), SystemMessage(content='What is your guess?', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\u001b[0m\n",
