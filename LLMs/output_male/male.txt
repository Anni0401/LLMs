 You said: 'What do you think about the hint SPACE? Should we guess words related to astronomy or physical space?'
teammember_RED_1 said: 'I think we should consider both options, but since we have 5 words left to guess, let's start with the physical space and see if we can find any connections to words on the board.'
You said: 'I think BLOCK could be a good fit for physical space, what do you think? Should we guess another word or end our turn?'
teammember_RED_1 said: 'I agree BLOCK is a good fit, but I think we should guess another word. How about words related to a yard or a specific location?'
